vagrant-Ambari-2.0
================================

# Introduction

Vagrant project to spin up a cluster of 6 virtual machines with Ambari v2.0 and HDP v2.2.6. Java/Ant/Maven/Scala/R/Docker environment is setup in all the nodes.

1. node1 : Ambari Service + HDP management node
2. node2 : HDP management node
3. node3 : HDP management node
4. node4 : HDP compute node
5. node5 : HDP compute node
6. node6 : HDP compute node

# Getting Started

1. [Download and install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Download and install Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
3. Run ```vagrant box add ubuntu https://oss-binaries.phusionpassenger.com/vagrant/boxes/latest/ubuntu-14.04-amd64-vbox.box```
4. Git clone this project, and change directory (cd) into this project (directory).
5. Run ```vagrant up``` to create the VM.
6. Run ```vagrant ssh``` to get into your VM. The VM name in vagrant is ambarinode1, ambarinode2 ... ambarinoden. While the ip of VMs depends on the scale of your Yarn cluster. If it is less then 10, the IP will be 10.211.75.101, .... 10.211.75.10n. Or you could run ```ssh``` directly with ip of VMs and username/password of demo/demo, and then execute "su - root" with password of vagrant.
7. Run ```vagrant destroy``` when you want to destroy and get rid of the VM.
8. The directory of /vagrant is mounted in each VM by vagrant if you want to access host machine from VM. You could also use win-sshfs if you want to access the local file system of VM from host machine. Please refer to http://code.google.com/p/win-sshfs/ for details.

Some gotcha's.

* Make sure you download Vagrant v1.7.1 or higher and VirtualBox 4.3.20 or higher with extension package
* Make sure when you clone this project, you preserve the Unix/OSX end-of-line (EOL) characters. The scripts will fail with Windows EOL characters. If you are using Windows, please make sure the following configuration is configured in your .gitconfig file which is located in your home directory ("C:\Users\yourname" in Win7 and after, and "C:\Documents and Settings\yourname" in WinXP). Refer to http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration for details of git configuration.
```
[core]
    autocrlf = false
    safecrlf = true
```
* Make sure you have 10Gb of free memory for the VMs. You may change the Vagrantfile to specify smaller memory requirements.
* This project has NOT been tested with the other providers such as VMware for Vagrant.
* You may change the script (common.sh) to point to a different location for Hadoop, Zookeeper .... to be downloaded from. 

# Advanced Stuff

If you have the resources (CPU + Disk Space + Memory), you may modify Vagrantfile to have even more HDFS DataNodes, YARN NodeManagers, and Spark slaves. Just find the line that says "numNodes = 6" in Vagrantfile and increase that number. The scripts should dynamically provision the additional slaves for you.

# Make the VMs setup faster
You can make the VM setup even faster if you pre-download the Hadoop ... and Oracle JDK into the /resources directory.

* /resources/jdk-7u76-linux-x64.tar.gz
* ....

The setup script will automatically detect if these files (with precisely the same names) exist and use them instead. If you are using slightly different versions, you will have to modify the script accordingly.

# Post Installation
## Build Slider HBase Package

```
cd /vagrant/resources
wget http://archive.apache.org/dist/hbase/stable/hbase-1.0.1.1-bin.tar.gz
cd src
git clone git://git.apache.org/incubator-slider.git
cd incubator-slider/
git checkout -b slider-0.80.0-incubating --track origin/releases/slider-0.80.0-incubating
cd /vagrant/resources/src/incubator-slider/app-packages/hbase
mvn clean package -Phbase-app-package -Dpkg.version=1.0.1.1-bin -Dhbase.version=1.0.1.1 -Dpkg.name=hbase-1.0.1.1-bin.tar.gz -Dpkg.src=/vagrant/resources/
```

## Create Slider View

# Access Point
Ambari WebGUI: http://10.211.75.101:8080

Postgre DB:
  username/password:

# Install Hadoop with Ambari

Replace /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/resource_management/core/providers/package/apt.py by /vagrant/resources/apt.py to add option of apt-get of "-o Dpkg::Options::=--force-overwrite"

# Manage Ambari

Run following command to start/restart Ambari server

```
ambari-server start|restart
```

Run following command to start/restart Ambari agent

```
ambari-agent start|restart hostname
```

# Vagrant boxes
A list of available Vagrant boxes is shown at http://www.vagrantbox.es. 

# Vagrant box location
The Vagrant box is downloaded to the ~/.vagrant.d/boxes directory. On Windows, this is C:/Users/{your-username}/.vagrant.d/boxes.

# Trouble-shooting YARN

In YARN terminology, executors and application masters run inside "containers". YARN has two modes for handling container logs after an application has completed. If log aggregation is turned on (with the yarn.log-aggregation-enable config), container logs are copied to HDFS and deleted on the local machine. These logs can be viewed from anywhere on the cluster with the ```yarn logs``` command.

```
yarn logs -applicationId <app ID>
```

will print out the contents of all log files from all containers from the given application.

When log aggregation isnâ€™t turned on, logs are retained locally on each machine under YARN_APP_LOGS_DIR, which is usually configured to /tmp/logs or $HADOOP_HOME/logs/userlogs depending on the Hadoop version and installation. Viewing logs for a container requires going to the host that contains them and looking in this directory. Subdirectories organize log files by application ID and container ID.

To review per-container launch environment, increase yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec to a large value (e.g. 36000), and then access the application cache through yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs (by default /tmp/hadoop-root/nm-local-dir/usercache/root/appcache) on the nodes on which containers are launched. This directory contains the launch script, JARs, and all environment variables used for launching each container. This process is useful for debugging classpath problems in particular. (Note that enabling this requires admin privileges on cluster settings and a restart of all node managers. Thus, this is not applicable to hosted clusters).
